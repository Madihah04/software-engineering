## Objectives üí°
 - [ ] To differentiate users and system requirements
 - [ ] To understand functional requirements (FR) and non-
functional requirements (NFR)
 - [ ] To know diverse techniques to write requirements
specification
 - [ ] To understand the main requirements engineering
activities that are elicitation, analysis and validation

## Type of Requirements üóíÔ∏è
### What is a requirement ?
 - [ ] Requirement engineering is a process that involves eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the requirements for a software system or product. It is a systematic approach that ensures that the stakeholders' needs and expectations are clearly understood and documented, and that the resulting system or product meets those needs.
 - [ ] Requirement engineering involves identifying and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements for the software system or product, as well as any constraints that may impact the development or operation of the system. This process is typically iterative, with requirements being refined and updated throughout the software development lifecycle.
 - [ ] The objective of requirement engineering is to ensure that the resulting system or product meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders, is of high quality, and is delivered on time and within budget. It also involves managing the requirements throughout the development process, ensuring that they remain consistent and that any changes are properly tracked and managed.
 - [ ] Effective requirement engineering is critical to the success of a software development project, as it helps to ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders, is delivered on time and within budget, and is of high quality.


### User Requirements VS System Requirements 

|  **User Requirements**| **System Requirements** |
|--|--|
| Use case diagrams, constraints and operational statements of the user's language of services to depict. | Descriptions of systems functions, operational constraints and structured documents that defines how and what to implement
| **Examples :** Management Usage, Customer Usage, Developers, Third Party Usage  | **Examples :** System Users, Developers, System Architecture, Network System Models, Functional Models|
